## Data Engineering Fundamentals (30%)

**Q: Explain the concept of ETL/ELT and their key differences?**

**A: ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) and ELT (Extract-Load-Transform)** are two common data integration approaches used to 
move data from various sources to a target system, often a data warehouse. Here's a breakdown of each and their key differences:

* **ETL:**
    * **Extract:** Data is extracted from various sources (databases, APIs, flat files, etc.).
    * **Transform:** Extracted data is cleaned, validated, and transformed into a consistent format 
	suitable for the target system. This often involves data cleansing, schema changes, and aggregations. 
    * **Load:** Transformed data is loaded into the target system. This might involve a staging area for 
	temporary storage before final loading.

* **ELT:**
    * **Extract:** Similar to ETL, data is extracted from various sources.
    * **Load:** Extracted data is directly loaded into the target system (data lake or warehouse) in its raw or semi-raw format.
    * **Transform:** Once loaded, the data is transformed within the target system. This can leverage the processing power of 
	the data warehouse itself or utilize specialized tools.

**Key Differences:**

* **Transformation Timing:** ETL transforms before loading, while ELT transforms after loading.
* **Data Staging:** ETL often requires a dedicated staging area for data transformation, 
	while ELT can avoid it, potentially reducing processing time.
* **Flexibility:** ELT offers more flexibility for handling diverse data sources with varying 
	formats since the transformation happens within the target system. 
	However, complex transformations might require additional development effort in the target environment.

**Q: Describe the different types of data sources you've worked with (e.g., databases, APIs, flat files).**

**A:** In my experience, I've worked with a variety of data sources, including:

* **Structured Data Sources:**
    * **Relational Databases:** These are widely used for storing structured data in a tabular format (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle). 
	They provide well-defined schemas and efficient access methods for querying specific data.
    * **NoSQL Databases:** These offer flexibility for handling unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra). 
		They are often used for large datasets with varying schema requirements.
* **Unstructured Data Sources:**
    * **Flat Files:** These are simple text files with data organized in rows and columns (e.g., CSV, TSV). 
	They are a common way to share data between different systems due to their simplicity.
    * **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):** These provide programmatic access to data from external 
	applications or services. They allow for real-time or scheduled data retrieval based on specific API calls.
* **Streaming Data Sources:**
    * **Apache Kafka/Apache Flume:** These are message brokers or streaming data platforms used for capturing and 
	ingesting real-time data feeds from various sources. They enable continuous data processing pipelines.


**Q: How do you handle data quality issues like missing values or inconsistencies?**

**A:** Data quality is a critical aspect of data engineering. Here's how I approach data quality issues:

* **Identification:** I utilize data profiling techniques to identify data quality issues like missing values, 
	inconsistencies, and invalid formats. This can involve tools for data exploration and analysis.
* **Data Cleaning:** Based on the identified issues, I implement data cleaning techniques:
    * **Missing Values:** Depending on the data and context, I might use imputation methods 
	(e.g., mean/median imputation, category-specific values) or remove rows with excessive missing values.
    * **Inconsistencies:** Data validation rules are established to catch inconsistencies in data formats or values. 
	Cleaning steps like standardization or normalization might be applied to ensure consistency.
* **Documentation:** I document the identified data quality issues and the applied cleaning techniques for 
	future reference and maintainability of the data pipeline. This ensures transparency and facilitates troubleshooting.

**Q: Explain the concept of data partitioning and its benefits for data warehousing.**

**A:** Data partitioning is a technique used to logically divide large tables in a data warehouse based on specific columns 
	(e.g., date, region, customer ID). This improves performance and manageability:

* **Improved Query Performance:** Partition pruning allows queries to access only relevant data partitions instead of 
	scanning the entire table. This significantly speeds up retrieval for queries focusing on specific partitions.
* **Scalability:** Data warehouses can be easily scaled by adding or removing partitions as data volume grows. 
		This allows for efficient storage and management of massive datasets.
* **Efficient Operations:** Data maintenance tasks like backups, deletes, or updates can be performed on individual partitions instead of the entire table. This reduces processing time and improves overall efficiency.


## Spark and Distributed Processing (20%)

**Q: Explain the Apache Spark ecosystem and its core components (Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, etc.).**

**A:** The Apache Spark ecosystem is a suite of tools designed for large-scale data processing and analytics. Here's a breakdown of 
	its core components:

* **Spark Core:** This is the foundation of Spark, providing the distributed processing engine that manages tasks across a cluster of 
		machines. It handles task scheduling, communication between worker nodes, and memory management.
* **Spark SQL:** This component enables large-scale SQL queries on structured data stored in various data formats. 
	It leverages Spark's distributed processing capabilities to perform efficient analytics on massive datasets.
* **Spark Streaming:** This framework is designed for real-time data processing of continuous data streams. 
	It allows you to ingest, process, and analyze data streams from sources like Kafka or Flume in near real-time.

		distributed datasets. It offers functionalities for building, training, and evaluating various machine learning models.

These are just some of the core components. The Spark ecosystem also includes other tools like Spark GraphX for graph processing and 
	SparkR for using R within the Spark framework.

**Q: Describe how Spark achieves fault tolerance and data recovery in distributed processing.**

**A:** Fault tolerance is crucial for ensuring reliable processing in a distributed environment. 
		Spark employs several mechanisms to achieve this:

* **Lineage Tracking:** Spark tracks the dependencies between operations in a job. If a task fails, 
	Spark can identify the dependent tasks and re-execute them using the available data from successful preceding tasks. 
		This minimizes data loss and avoids complete job restarts.
* **In-Memory Computing:** Spark prioritizes keeping intermediate data in memory across worker nodes. 
	This allows for faster task re-execution in case of failures compared to relying solely on disk storage.
* **Checksums:** Spark calculates checksums for data partitions. If a partition becomes corrupt, the checksum mismatch is detected during task execution, and Spark can recover the data from a healthy replica.

These mechanisms work together to ensure data consistency and job completion even if individual worker nodes encounter failures.

**Q: How do you optimize Spark jobs for performance? (e.g., data partitioning, caching)**

**A:** Optimizing Spark jobs for performance involves various techniques:

* **Data Partitioning:** As mentioned earlier, partitioning large datasets based on frequently used columns allows Spark to
 access only relevant data partitions during queries. This significantly reduces processing time for specific data subsets.
* **Caching:** Frequently accessed data can be cached in memory across worker nodes. This eliminates redundant 
	computations and data access from slower storage for subsequent tasks that require the same data, leading to faster processing.
* **Code Optimization:** Optimizing the code within your Spark jobs can improve performance. 
		This includes using efficient data structures, avoiding unnecessary shuffles (data movement between nodes), 
		and leveraging vectorized operations for faster computations.
* **Resource Management:**  Properly allocating resources like CPU cores and memory to Spark jobs ensures 
		efficient utilization of the cluster.

**Q: Have you used any libraries like PySpark or Scala for working with Spark? If so, showcase your knowledge of their functionalities for data manipulation and transformations.**

**A:** Yes, I have experience working with Spark using libraries like PySpark and potentially Scala (depending on the role). 
	Here's a brief overview of their functionalities for data manipulation and transformations:

* **PySpark:** This Python API provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with Spark. It allows you to:
    * Load data from various sources (e.g., CSV, JSON, databases) into Spark DataFrames and Datasets.
    * Perform data transformations using powerful operations like filtering, selecting specific columns, joining DataFrames, and applying various functions.
    * Utilize built-in functions for data cleaning, aggregations, and other data manipulation tasks.
